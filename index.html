    <h1>Causal Inference Course</h1>
    <p>Causal inference is one of the most important and challenging aims in statistical and data science. 
      Many fields, from clinical medicine to social science, seek to use empirical data to learn how different factors affect the world.
      This course covers the latest developments in causal inference methods and gives practical explanations about applying these methods 
      to real research questions.</p>
    <h2>Course Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The causal roadmap and causal languages (potential outcomes framework)</li>
      <li>Directed acyclic graphs</li>
      <li> Target trial emulation </li>
      <li> Estimating marginal causal effects (Point Treatment) under â€œno unobserved confounding"
           using g-methods: g-computation, inverse probabiity of treatment weights and doubly robust estimation</li>
      <li>Instrumental Variable methods for obtaining causal effects under unobserved confouning"</li>
      <li>Introduction to Mediation analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Intended Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the potential outcomes framework and how to apply it</li>
      <li>Learn how to use directed acyclic graphs</li>
      <li>Estimate causal effects using observational data and the required assumptions</li>
      <li>Interpret causal analyses</li>


      The course is a mixture of lectures and applied practicals. The practicals include pen-and-paper exercises and data analysis in R and Stata. All of the analytical practicals will use simulated data and exemplar code that you can take with you. 
      /ul>
    <h2>Who Should Apply?</h2>
    <p>This course is aimed at people conducting applied epidemiological, medical, and other quantitative research,
      from PhD students to experienced researchers interested in learning more about causal inference methods. 
      Participants should have familiarity with applied statistical analysis and an MSc in statistics, data science, or other quantitative subjects.</p>
