    <h1>Causal Inference Course</h1>
    <p>Causal inference is one of the most important and challenging aims in statistical and data science. Many fields, from clinical medicine to social science, seek to use empirical data to learn how different factors affect the world. This course covers the latest developments in causal inference methods and gives practical explanations about applying these methods to real research questions.</p>
    <h2>Course Content</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potential outcomes framework</li>
      <li>Directed acyclic graphs</li>
      <li>Causal effects estimation using observational data</li>
      <li>Interpretation of causal analyses</li>
      <li>And more...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Intended Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the potential outcomes framework and how to apply it</li>
      <li>Learn how to use directed acyclic graphs</li>
      <li>Estimate causal effects using observational data and the required assumptions</li>
      <li>Interpret causal analyses</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who Should Apply?</h2>
    <p>This course is aimed at people conducting applied epidemiological, medical, and other quantitative research, from PhD students to experienced researchers interested in learning more about causal inference methods.
